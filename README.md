# cmpm-121-final
The final project for fall 2024 cmpm-121.

# Devlog entry - 13 Nov 2024

## Introducing the Team
- alhinator: Engine lead. Will be heading engine choice, filestructure organization, documentation standards.
- tranhunter84: Design lead.  Will be responsible for setting the creative direction of the project, and establishing the look and feel of the game.
## Tools and Materials
- For our platform, we intend on using default HTML canvas rendering. Our initial idea is to use an ascii-art style, so complex graphic capabilities are not at all necessary. We will be using Vite for compiling and packaging, and 
- We plan to use Typescript as both our primary and alternative language. This will allow us to maintain strict type checking as well as syntactical structure throughout the change halfway through the project. We'll likely be using JSON to store premade data structures, as well as utilizing it for localstorage reading and writing.
- Our Alternate platform is the Phaser.js framework. We will remain in Typescript, but switch to the scene-based Phaser engine for drawing and rendering our game. We chose this alternate engine due to our shared experience and familiarity with the platform, and the fact that we won't need to change any of our logic or data storage code, only our display, input, and scene code.
## Outlook
- (alhinator) I hope to gain experience in the realm of properly documenting all my code to JSDoc standards. I've had experience with that form of documentation before, but never held myself to the standard of documenting Everything.
- (tranhunter84) I hope to learn more about team-based development of small-scale projects that get completed on a short timeline, and specifically learn more about maintaining uniform coding standards across code changes from multiple team members.
